[Video from the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaPa_9zL2ME)


This is the source code for the talk given during the Barcelona Android User Group talk given by Edward Huerta.

This is the initial release that includes a demonstration of the normal spotlightview. You can run the app to get a demonstration of the app shown in the presentation.

You can also copy the spotlighttutoriallibrary into your project and add this line to your application build.grade:

compile project(":spotlighttutoriallibrary")

Don't forget that your settings.gradle should have something similar to:

include ':app', ':spotlighttutoriallibrary'

(Maybe the ':app' is different in your app because you named it something else.)

Just look at the sample application to read how it is setup. If you have problems, please contact me at edward@elements.nl I will be happy to help you.

Soon, I will publish the example app as an apk file so that you can download it and run the app. But also I will publish the library aar file, I just need
to find a place to host these files first and then I will update this repo with the information.

I will also be putting here the link to the blog post that explains the code in detail. So stay tuned.
